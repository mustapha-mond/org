The goal of this project is to enable a user to configure an organization structure of any depth and complexity using Ethereum addresses as nodes. The code currently supports:

   *Referential integrity
 
   *Hierarchical integrity
 
   *CRUD operations
 
   *Dynamic linking
 
   *Matrix organizations
   
   *Transaction integration
 
 The use case provides for a Purchase Order approval scenario whereby a PO is submitted for approval and migrates up the organization hierarchy until the appropriate approval level is reached. The node determined by this process becomes the approver of the PO.

The eventual goal is to be able to add plug-ins for any type of business process that would refer to the org structure.
